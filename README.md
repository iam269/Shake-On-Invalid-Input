# Shake On Invalid Input 🎉

A lightweight JavaScript library that adds a fun shake animation to form inputs when validation fails. Perfect for enhancing user experience with visual feedback! 🚀📝✨

## Features 🌟
- **Simple Integration**: Easy to add to any form input with minimal code changes.
- **Customizable Animation**: Shake effect with CSS keyframes for smooth performance.
- **Error Feedback**: Displays error messages alongside the shake animation.
- **Lightweight**: No external dependencies, pure vanilla JavaScript and CSS.

## How It Works 🔧
When form validation fails, the input field gets a "shake" class applied, triggering a CSS animation that shakes the input horizontally. An error message appears, and both are automatically removed after 500ms.
